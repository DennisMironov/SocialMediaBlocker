# Social Media Blocker Extension
Chrome extension that allows specific websites to be blocked during the given hours.

## Features
- Block websites such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc.
- Choose the range of time in which websites will be blocked
- Works entirely on the background and will block/unblock websites automatically when needed
- Settings are synced to the Chrome accoumt, meaning that the settings are reflected on any other device with sync on

## Usage
As the extension is not currently published on the Chrome Web Store, the extension must be added manually via developer mode. The following steps from Google explain how to add the extension.
1. Download the contents of this repository and store all contents in a separate folder
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. At the top right, turn on Developer mode
4. At the top left, click "Load unpacked"
5. Find the extension folder and select it
6. The extension should now be accessible from the browser's extension menu

## Roadmap
Potential features that are being looked into and may be included in the future.
- Custom websites
- Block/unblock times for each individual website as opposed to one time for all websites
- "Always blocked" option
- Some form of an optional password system to prevent users from manually unblocking websites during the block time period

## Acknowledgements
- Chrome API
